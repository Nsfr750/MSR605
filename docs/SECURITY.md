# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

This document outlines the security practices, policies, and guidelines for the MSR605 Card Reader/Writer project. We take security seriously and are committed to maintaining a secure application for handling sensitive card data.

## üîí Security Overview

The MSR605 application handles magnetic stripe card data, which may contain sensitive information such as:
- Financial card data (credit/debit cards)
- Personal identification information
- Access control credentials
- Other sensitive card-based data

### Security Principles

1. **Data Protection**: All sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit
2. **Least Privilege**: The application operates with minimal required permissions
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented
4. **Security by Design**: Security considerations are integrated throughout the development lifecycle

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Always use the latest version of the application
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: If using authentication features, use strong, unique passwords
3. **Secure Environment**: Run the application on a secure, trusted system
4. **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular backups of encrypted data
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review application logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review
2. **Static Analysis**: Regular static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security scanning of dependencies
4. **Security Testing**: Regular security testing including penetration testing
5. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date security documentation

## üîç Threat Model

### Identified Threats

1. **Data Interception**: Unauthorized interception of card data during transmission
2. **Data Storage Compromise**: Unauthorized access to stored card data
3. **Malicious Code**: Introduction of malicious code into the application
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized elevation of application privileges
5. **Denial of Service**: Attacks that prevent legitimate use of the application

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
2. **Access Controls**: Strict access controls prevent unauthorized data access
3. **Code Signing**: Application binaries are signed to ensure integrity
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Application runs with minimal required privileges
5. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
