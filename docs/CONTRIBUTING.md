## üõ† Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Use [Google Style Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black's default)
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Sort imports using `isort` (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- Format code using `black` (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- Keep functions small and focused (preferably < 50 lines)

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Use `pytest` for testing
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test on multiple Python versions (3.10+)
- Run tests locally before pushing:
  ```bash
  # Run all tests
  pytest
  
  # Run tests with coverage
  pytest --cov=script --cov-report=term-missing
  
  # Run a specific test file
  pytest tests/test_card_reader.py -v
  ```

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation when adding new features
